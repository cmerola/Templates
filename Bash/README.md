# scripting_templates
I'm sharing script templates in various languages with others that might find them useful. Especially scripts that took awhile to figure out, but can be applied to many other people's needs, or simply just to be used a references.

The purpose is to provide real-world scripts for rapid development of scripts that already contain very useful features such as: 

1) Passing --verbose arg for debugging
2) Basic Input Sanitation
3) Easy Color Formatting
4) Display Execution Times
5) Easy Logging
6) File Locking (flock to ensure only one instance at any given moment)
7) Commentary / Explanations
